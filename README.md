# Print-Extraction

This tool would be used to extract all vector-based text data from a BOUD PDF print to run analysis on the Ptext. The quantity of pole counts and type, tree trim locations, span types, span lengths, secondary poles, concrete poles, and net new poles are extracted and put into a work order summary excel sheet as well as a txt file which gives more details such as the P number and S number associated with each object.
